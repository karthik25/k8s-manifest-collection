This persistent volume is then used in a persistent volume claim by explicitly specifying the persistent volume name in the volumeName field.

This particular example does not use statefulsets for the redis pod though. A service is also created that would expose the redis service internally within the cluster using a ClusterIP. Then, a pod that runs a .net core worker is created that communicates with the redis pod using the service name and the port number."
